        <h1>Five places to visit near Mount Fuji</h1>
        <h2>A curated selection of scenic destinations not far from Tokyo</h2>
        <p>Known for its beaches and mountainous terrain, and only about an hour from Tokyo, eastern Shizuoka is a popular and convenient side trip out of the city. The region includes popular sightseeing destinations like the Izu Peninsula, which is designated a UNESCO geopark, and a large portion of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park is located there as well. Half of Mount Fuji sits in eastern Shizuoka, and one can enjoy views of the iconic mountain from the region. Those looking to escape the city to be surrounded by nature should definitely consider visiting the Izu Peninsula and the area around Mount Fuji in eastern Shizuoka.

        Eastern Shizuoka is easily accessed by bullet train and has three stations, Atami, Mishima and Shin-Fuji stations, along the Tokaido Shinkansen. The one way journey from Tokyo to either one of the three stations takes about an hour. In this article, I will be introducing ten spots spread across ten cities and towns, some of which offer excellent views of Mount Fuji when the weather is clear. All the spots are accessible by a variety of public transport, but a rental car provides greater flexibility and convenience.</p>

        <li><h3>Kiunkaku</h3>
        Located in Atami City, Kiunkaku was completed in 1919 as a holiday home for a businessman and then was converted into a traditional Japanese-style inn in 1947. Kiunkaku operated as an inn for about 50 years, during which time famous authors like Mishima Yukio and Dazai Osamu stayed over.
          
        The former ryokan is now owned by the city and preserved as a cultural property. Several buildings make up the entire complex, and a tour of the interior takes one on a journey to see both Japanese and Western designs and architectural styles up close. Of interest are the vividly colored walls in the traditional Japanese-style rooms as well as the tiled Roman baths. A stroll through the garden allows visitors to appreciate seasonal flowers and the exterior of the buildings.<br />
        Access: 20 minutes on foot from Atami Station on the Tokaido Shinkansen.

        <li><h3>Mount Omuro</h3>Mount Omuro is one of the symbols of Ito City. Its last eruption 4000 years ago changed the surrounding landscape and created the unique geological structures found along the area's coastline. Today, the 580 meter tall mountain is a popular sightseeing attraction, and a chairlift takes one up to the peak. At the top, visitors typically go for a scenic walk around its rim, which takes a leisurely 30 minutes, and enjoy panoramic views of Mount Fuji, the Pacific Ocean and the Izu Islands when the weather is clear.<br />
        Access: 20 minutes by bus from Izu-Kogen Station on the Izukyu Railway.

        <div class="io">
        <li><h3>Inatori Onsen</h3>Located in southeastern Izu Peninsula, Higashi Izu Town is known for its coastal hot spring villages, of which there are six. Staying overnight at an onsen accommodation is a nice way to relax and unwind, and soaking in a hot spring bath with ocean views is a luxury not to be missed.

        Inatori Onsen is the southernmost hot spring village in Higashi Izu Town with a number of accommodations built along the coastline. A stroll along the shoreline provides views of the port of Inatori as well as of the Izu Islands when the weather is clear.<br />
        Access: 15-20 minutes on foot from Izu-Inatori Station on the Izukyu Railway.

        <div class="cape">
        <li><h3>Cape Tsumekizaki</h3>
        Near the southern end of the Izu Peninsula is Cape Tsumekizaki, where visitors are treated to views of a rugged coastline, seasonal flowers and secluded beaches. The beaches near the cape, like Kujuppama Beach, do not get as crowded as the ones in Atami, and the clear waters provide nice snorkeling and swimming experiences. Walking trails connect the beaches with the cape, where a lighthouse stands at the waters' edge, warning passing ships of the rocky coast. Additionally, the coastline consists mostly of columnar joints, which can be seen along the walking trails and along the shoreline.<br />
        Access: 20 minutes by bus from Izukyu-Shimoda Station on the Izukyu Railway.</li>

        <div class="obu">
        <li><h3>Obuchi Sasaba</h3>
        Some of Japanâ€™s best known symbols are Mount Fuji and green tea, and the two together make a timeless image that many photographers pursue. Shizuoka Prefecture has the most number of tea plantations in Japan, and over at the scenic Obuchi Sasaba, one can have a view of the tea fields with Mount Fuji in the background. The tea fields at Obuchi Sasaba were painstakingly maintained so as to prevent the view from being spoiled by obstructions like power lines, and the classic view we can enjoy today is the result of the tea farmers' hard work and conservation efforts. A visit to Obuchi Sasaba is definitely worth the trek when the weather is clear.<br />
        Access: About 25 minutes by taxi from Fuji Station on the JR Tokaido Line or Shin-Fuji Station on the Tokaido Shinkansen.</li>
