        <p>Mount Fuji, highest mountain in Japan. It rises to 12,388 feet (3,776 metres) near the Pacific Ocean coast in Yamanashi and Shizuoka ken (prefectures) of central Honshu, about 60 miles (100 km) west of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area. It is a volcano that has been dormant since its last eruption, in 1707, but is still generally classified as active by geologists. The mountain is the major feature of <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/place/Fuji-Hakone-Izu-National-Park"> Fuji Hakone Izu National Park</a> (1936), and it is at the centre of a UNESCO World Heritage site designated in 2013.</p>

        <h2 >CULTURAL SIGNIFICANT</h2>
        <P>The origin of the mountain’s name is uncertain. It first appears as Fuji no Yama in Hitachi no kuni fudoki (713 ce), an early government record. Among the several theories about the source of the name is that it is derived from an Ainu term meaning “fire,” coupled with san, the Japanese word for “mountain.” The Chinese ideograms (kanji) now used to write Fuji connote more of a sense of good fortune or well-being. In the present day the Japanese typically refer to the mountain as Fujisan, whereas foreign visitors tend to refer to the mountain somewhat incorrectly as Mount Fujiyama, which translates to “Mount Fuji mountain” in the Japanese language.</P>
        <p>Fuji, with its graceful conical form, has become famous throughout the world and is considered the sacred symbol of Japan. Among Japanese there is a sense of personal identification with the mountain, and each summer thousands of Japanese climb to the shrine on its peak. Its image has been reproduced countless times in <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/art/Japanese-art">Japanese art</a>, perhaps no more famously than in the series of woodblock prints Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai, which were originally published between 1826 and 1833.</p>

        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p>ccording to tradition, the volcano was formed in 286 bce by an earthquake. The truth is somewhat more complex. The age of Fuji is disputed, but it seems to have formed during the past 2.6 million years on a base dating from up to 65 million years ago; the first eruptions and the first peaks probably occurred sometime after 700,000 years ago. The earliest precursors to Mount Fuji were Komitake (which forms the mountain’s north slope) and Ashitaka-yama (which sits southeast of the mountain). Mount Fuji is a <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/science/stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> that rose sometime after 400,000 years ago between the peaks of Komitake and Ashitaka-yama. The present-day mountain is a composite of three successive volcanoes: at the bottom is Komitake, which was surmounted by Ko Fuji (“Old Fuji”) about 100,000 years ago and, finally, by the most recent, Shin Fuji (“New Fuji”). Over the millennia, the lava and other ejecta from Ko Fuji covered most of Komitake, although the top of the latter’s cone continued to protrude from the slope of Ko Fuji. Shin Fuji probably first became active about 10,000 years ago and has continued ever since to smolder or erupt occasionally. In the process it has filled in the slopes of its predecessors and added the summit zone, producing the mountain’s now nearly perfect tapered form.</p>

        <p>The base of the volcano is about 78 miles (125 km) in circumference and has a diameter of some 25 to 30 miles (40 to 50 km). At the summit of Mount Fuji the crater spans about 1,600 feet (500 metres) in surface diameter and sinks to a depth of about 820 feet (250 metres). Around the jagged edges of the crater are eight peaks—Oshaidake, Izudake, Jojudake, Komagatake, Mushimatake, Kengamine, Hukusandake, and Kusushidake.</p>

        <p>Hakone (箱根町, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 1 October 2023, the town had a population of 10,965,[1][2] and total area of 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi).<br />

        Hakone is a notable spa town and a popular tourist destination due to its many hot springs being within view of nearby Mount Fuji, the most visited mountain in Japan.</p>

        <h2>TOURISM AND RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <P>On the northern slopes of Mount Fuji lie the Fuji Five Lakes (Fuji Goko), comprising, east to west, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Sai, Lake Shōji, and Lake Motosu, all formed by the damming effects of lava flows. The lowest, Lake Kawaguchi, at 2,726 feet (831 metres), is noted for the inverted reflection of Mount Fuji on its still waters. Tourism in the area is highly developed, with amusement parks, botanical gardens, ski resorts, and other recreational sites. Lake Yamanaka, the largest of the lakes (at 2.5 square miles [6.4 square km]), is one of the most popular resort areas. West of the mountain, the valley between Mount Fuji and Mount Kenashi also hosts numerous golf courses and other attractions. Southeast of Mount Fuji is the wooded volcanic <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/place/Hakone"> Hakone</a> region, well known for its hot-springs resorts at Yumoto and Gōra.</P>

        <h2>FUN FACTS OF MOUNTAIN FUJI</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Mt Fuji is on an<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_junction>"> active triple junction</a> of tectonic activity. It has been active for over 1,000 years, but the last eruption was recorded on December 16, 1707.</li>
        <img src = "https://japanupclose.web-japan.org/files/100462019.jpeg"alt="The deep volcanic crater at Mt.Fuji's summit"/>
        <li>Mt Fuji became the first ski site in Japan in 1911, when Austrian soldiers, Major Theodore Edler von Lerch and Egon Edler von Kratzer skied down from the 9th stage. Today, there is still a plaque on the 5th stage of Mt Fuji commemorating this event.</li>
        <li>In 1896, during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, it was discovered that<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Shan"> Taiwan 's Yushan Mountain</a> was 3,952 meters above sea level, higher than Mount Fuji, and the Ministry of Colonization officially designated Yushan Mountain as a "new high mountain" in 1897. Later, it was found that Taiwan's Xueshan Mountain was 3,886 meters above sea level, also higher than Mount Fuji, so it was designated as a "second high mountain" in 1923.</li>
        <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuji_(apple)">Fuji apple</a> is a variety of apple , but has no direct relationship with Mount Fuji.</li>
        <li>Mt. Taranaki on New Zealand's North Island was used as the filming background for the movie "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Samurai">The Last Samurai "</a> to replace Mount Fuji because of its similar appearance to Mount Fuji. </li>
